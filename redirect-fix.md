# Fixing Redirect Loop in Vercel Deployment

## Issue Identified
The Vercel deployment is showing a redirect loop error:
- Error message: "Esta página não está funcionando"
- Error code: ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS
- URL: portaluno-71h3joplg-edunexia.vercel.app/pt-BR

## Potential Causes
1. **Locale Redirect Issues**: The application is trying to redirect based on locale settings, causing an infinite loop
2. **Authentication Redirect Loop**: NextAuth or custom authentication logic may be causing redirect loops
3. **Middleware Conflicts**: Next.js middleware might be conflicting with Vercel's edge functions

## Recommended Fixes

### 1. Simplify Locale Handling
We've already started this by modifying the `[locale]/layout.tsx` file to remove the locale detection logic temporarily. We should:
- Create a simplified middleware.ts file that handles locale redirects properly
- Ensure there's a fallback for missing locales

### 2. Fix Authentication Redirects
- Ensure NextAuth redirects have proper conditions to prevent loops
- Check for circular redirects in protected routes

### 3. Vercel Configuration
- Add a `vercel.json` configuration to handle redirects properly:

```json
{
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "/",
      "destination": "/pt-BR",
      "permanent": false
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Debug with Vercel Logs
- Check Vercel deployment logs to identify the exact redirect chain
- Use Vercel's function logs to trace the redirect path

## Implementation Plan
1. Create a simplified middleware.ts file
2. Update NextAuth configuration to prevent redirect loops
3. Add proper Vercel configuration for redirects
4. Deploy and test the changes
