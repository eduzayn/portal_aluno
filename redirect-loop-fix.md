# Redirect Loop Fix for Vercel Deployment

## Issue
The Vercel deployment was showing a redirect loop error:
- Error message: "Esta página não está funcionando"
- Error code: ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS
- URL: portaluno-71h3joplg-edunexia.vercel.app/pt-BR

## Root Causes
1. **Multiple Redirect Mechanisms**: The application had several redirect mechanisms that were conflicting:
   - Middleware redirecting all paths to include locale prefix (/pt-BR)
   - Root page redirecting based on authentication status
   - NextAuth redirects for protected routes
   - Locale handling in the application

2. **Locale Handling**: The application was trying to redirect based on locale settings, causing an infinite loop

3. **Authentication Redirects**: The authentication flow was causing redirect loops when combined with locale redirects

## Solution
1. **Updated Middleware**: Modified the middleware.ts file to:
   - Skip redirects for API routes and static files
   - Only redirect the root path to avoid loops
   - Use cookies to track redirect counts and prevent excessive redirects
   - Allow direct access to student routes and auth routes

2. **Modified Root Page**: Updated the root page to show links instead of automatic redirects

3. **Updated Vercel Configuration**: Added proper route handling for locale paths in vercel.json

## Verification
- Deployed the changes to Vercel
- Verified the site loads without redirect errors
- Tested the authentication flow
- Verified all pages load correctly with the new middleware configuration

## Deployment Status
The changes have been committed and pushed to the branch "devin/1711166700-resolve-conflicts-pr8-11" and PR #22 has been created and merged. The Vercel deployment should now work correctly without redirect errors.
