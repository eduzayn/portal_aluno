## Verification Results

### Basic Functionality
- ❌ Site does not load due to deployment issues

- ❌ Unable to verify dashboard functionality
- ❌ Unable to verify other pages functionality

### Deployment Status

### Code Changes Status
- ✅ All code changes to fix the redirect loop have been successfully committed and pushed
- ✅ Middleware updated to prevent redirect loops
- ✅ Root page modified to use links instead of automatic redirects
- ✅ Vercel.json updated with proper route handling

## Recommendations
1. Check Vercel dashboard for deployment status and errors
2. Verify GitHub-Vercel integration is properly configured
3. Check build logs for any errors
4. Consider triggering a manual deployment
5. Verify environment variables are correctly set in Vercel

## Next Steps
The code changes to fix the redirect loop have been implemented, but the deployment verification cannot be completed due to deployment issues. The user needs to check the Vercel dashboard and resolve the deployment issues before the fix can be verified.
