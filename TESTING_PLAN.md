# Portal do Aluno - Testing Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing plan for the Portal do Aluno system. The plan focuses on ensuring the reliability, stability, and correctness of the application, with particular emphasis on authentication flows and core system components.

## Testing Objectives

1. **Ensure Authentication Reliability**: Verify that all authentication flows (login, registration, password reset) work correctly
2. **Validate Core Functionality**: Test critical student portal features like learning paths and dashboard
3. **Verify Data Services**: Ensure Supabase data services correctly fetch and manipulate data
4. **Maintain Type Safety**: Validate TypeScript type annotations throughout the codebase
5. **Ensure Component Rendering**: Verify UI components render correctly in various states

## Test Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Current Test Issues (Completed)
- ✅ Resolve React state update warnings by properly using `act()` and `waitFor()`
- ✅ Fix TypeScript type annotation issues in learning path component
- ✅ Add data-testid attributes to components for reliable testing
- ✅ Create simplified test utilities that don't rely on complex context mocking

### Phase 2: Enhance Test Coverage (In Progress)
- ✅ Create comprehensive tests for learning path component
- ✅ Implement proper mocking for Supabase client
- ✅ Add tests for authentication components
- ⬜ Add tests for student dashboard components
- ⬜ Add tests for course components
- ⬜ Add tests for certificate components

### Phase 3: Implement Advanced Testing (Future)
- ⬜ Add Mock Service Worker (MSW) for API mocking
- ⬜ Implement E2E testing with Playwright or Cypress
- ⬜ Add visual regression testing
- ⬜ Implement continuous integration testing workflow

## Testing Approach by Component

### Authentication Components
- **LoginForm**: Test form validation, submission, error handling, and successful login
- **RegisterForm**: Test form validation, submission, error handling, and successful registration
- **ForgotPasswordForm**: Test form validation, submission, and error handling

### Student Components
- **Dashboard**: Test loading states, data display, and navigation
- **LearningPath**: Test tab navigation, module display, and lesson interaction
- **Courses**: Test course listing, filtering, and detail views
- **Certificates**: Test certificate listing and download functionality

### Data Services
- **Supabase Client**: Test data fetching, error handling, and data manipulation
- **Authentication Services**: Test login, registration, and password reset functionality

## Test Execution Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Run individual component tests in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test components with their dependencies
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user flows (future implementation)

## Test Execution Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm run test -- src/components/auth/LoginForm.test.tsx
```

## Conclusion

This testing plan provides a comprehensive approach to ensuring the quality and reliability of the Portal do Aluno system. By following this plan, we can maintain a robust test suite that catches issues early and provides confidence in the application's functionality.
