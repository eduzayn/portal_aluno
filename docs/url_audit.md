## Analysis

### Implemented Pages (6/14)
- Dashboard

- Learning Path
- Certificates

- Notifications
- Grades
- Exercises

### Navigation Items vs. Implemented Pages

The navigation sidebar in `studentNavItems` includes 8 items:
1. Dashboard ✅
2. Meus Cursos ✅
3. Rota de Aprendizagem ✅
4. Material Didático ❌
5. Certificados ✅
6. Notificações ❌
7. Financeiro ✅
8. Perfil ❌

**Discrepancy:** 3 navigation items link to pages that are not yet implemented.

### Recommendations

1. Implement the missing pages that are included in the navigation sidebar:
   - Material Didático (`/student/materials`)
   - Notificações (`/student/notifications`)
   - Perfil (`/student/profile`)

2. Consider implementing or removing the other defined routes that are not in the navigation:
   - Grades
   - Exercises
   - Messages
   - Settings
   - Help

3. Update the routes definition to match the actual implementation plan if some routes are intentionally not implemented yet.
