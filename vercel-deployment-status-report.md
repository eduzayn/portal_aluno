# Vercel Deployment Status Report

## Current Status
- **Status**: ‚ùå Deployment Not Found
- **Error**: DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND
- **URL Tested**: 
  - https://portaluno-71h3joplg-edunexia.vercel.app
  - https://portal-aluno.vercel.app (Shows a different application)
  - https://portal-aluno-git-devin1711166700resolveconflictspr811-eduzayns-projects.vercel.app (Domain not resolved)

## Analysis
The Vercel deployment appears to be experiencing issues:

1. The primary deployment URL returns a "DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND" error
2. The alternative URL (portal-aluno.vercel.app) shows a different application
3. The branch-specific URL does not resolve

This suggests one of the following issues:
- The deployment process failed
- The deployment URL has changed
- The Vercel project configuration needs updating

## Recommended Actions
1. **Verify Vercel Integration**:
   - Check the Vercel dashboard to confirm the GitHub repository is properly connected
   - Verify that automatic deployments are enabled for the repository

2. **Check Build Logs**:
   - Review the Vercel build logs for any errors that might have caused deployment failure
   - Look for issues related to environment variables or build configuration

3. **Update Deployment Configuration**:
   - Ensure the vercel.json file is properly configured
   - Verify that all required environment variables are set in the Vercel project

4. **Manual Deployment**:
   - Consider triggering a manual deployment from the Vercel dashboard
   - This can help identify any specific build issues

## Next Steps
1. Access the Vercel dashboard to check deployment status
2. Review build logs for errors
3. Verify project configuration
4. Trigger a manual deployment if necessary

## Code Changes Status
All code changes to fix the redirect loop have been successfully committed and pushed to the repository:
- Updated middleware.ts to prevent redirect loops
- Modified root page.tsx to use links instead of automatic redirects
- Updated vercel.json with proper route handling
- Added documentation for the redirect loop fix

These changes should resolve the redirect loop issue once the deployment is successful.
